# ─── IMPORTS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# WHAT: sqlite3 is built into Python — no extra installs.
# WHY: We use it because it's a single file, zero setup, perfect for a 3‑day build.
import sqlite3

# WHAT: json lets us store Python lists/dicts as text in SQLite.
# WHY: SQLite has no native list type — we convert lists to JSON strings and back.
import json

# WHAT: datetime gives us timestamps for created_at and updated_at.
# WHY: We want to know *when* the lead came in and *when* it was last updated.
from datetime import datetime

# WHAT: contextmanager is a decorator that turns a function into a "with" block.
# WHY: It guarantees the database connection always closes, even if an error happens.

# WHAT: The name of the single file that holds everything.
# WHY: All tables live in this one file. Easy to backup, easy to delete for a fresh start.

@contextmanager
def get_db():
    """
    WHAT: Open the database file, give you a connection, and ALWAYS close it.
    WHY: If an exception happens inside the 'with' block, the connection still closes.
         This prevents "connection leaks" (too many open files).
    HOW TO USE:
        with get_db() as conn:
            cursor = conn.cursor()
            cursor.execute("SELECT ...")
            # connection auto-closes here, even if an error occurs

    STEP BY STEP:
        1. Open the connection to leads.db.
        2. Switch SQLite to WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode.
        3. Set row_factory so we can access columns by name (row["language"]).
        4. Try to 'yield' the connection to the caller (the code inside the 'with' block).
        5. After the 'with' block finishes (or even if it crashes), ALWAYS close the connection.

    FIX 9 — WHY WAL MODE:
        These functions run synchronously inside async route handlers
        (FastAPI/agent.py), which technically blocks the event loop for
        the duration of each call. In practice that's a few hundred
        microseconds per query — nothing close to the multi-second cost
        of a Gemini API round trip — so the real risk under concurrent
        load isn't per-call latency, it's *lock contention*: SQLite's
        default journal mode takes an exclusive lock on writes, so two
        simultaneous conversations updating their sessions at the same
        moment would serialize and one would wait. WAL mode lets reads
        proceed concurrently with a write, which covers the vast majority
        of contention this app would see (many sessions reading/updating
        their own independent rows). It's set with PRAGMA on every
        connection — cheap, and a no-op after the first time since it's
        persisted in the database file itself.
        For genuinely high traffic (many concurrent writers to the *same*
        row, or so much volume that even WAL's write serialization is a
        bottleneck), the real fix is migrating to aiosqlite or Postgres —
        see the commented-out aiosqlite line in requirements.txt.
