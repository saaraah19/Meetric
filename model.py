# ─── EXTRACTION SCHEMA (Gemini structured output) ─────────────────────
# WHAT: A deliberately separate, permissive schema used ONLY for asking
#       Gemini to read the conversation and pull out lead fields.
# WHY:  LeadProfile enforces business rules (stage must be a real stage,
#       language must be supported, etc.) that don't make sense to hand
#       to an extraction prompt — and mid-conversation, most fields are
#       legitimately still blank, which LeadProfile's validators don't
#       need to (and shouldn't) reject.
#
#       The *_estimate fields are the actual fix for "50 grand" / "500
#       pounds" / "a few hundred": instead of a regex trying to parse
#       human-written numbers, we ask the model — which already
#       understands "fifty thousand", "نصف مليون", "cinq cents euros" —
#       to just hand back a normalized float. Optional[float] (not a
#       plain float defaulting to 0) matters here: 0 means "they said
#       ASAP / no budget", None means "we genuinely don't know yet",
#       and those two cases must never be conflated in scoring.
